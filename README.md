Weather Forecast Database
This repository contains a weather forecast dataset that includes data related to weather conditions, temperatures, humidity, and other meteorological parameters. This data can be used for analysis, machine learning models, or other data science applications.

Dataset Overview
The dataset, stored in weather_forecast_data.csv, includes weather forecast information from various locations. It may include details such as:

Temperature
Humidity
Wind speed
Precipitation
Date and time of the forecast
File Structure
weather_forecast_data.csv: The main dataset containing weather forecast data.
Getting Started
To use the dataset in this repository, follow these steps:

Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Pandas library (for data manipulation)
Jupyter notebook or any Python IDE for running the code
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash

pip install pandas
Usage
You can load the dataset using Pandas for analysis. For example:

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
weather_data = pd.read_csv('weather_forecast_data.csv')

# View the first few rows of the dataset
print(weather_data.head())
After loading the data, you can perform various operations such as:

Data cleaning
Data visualization
Forecasting analysis
Machine learning
Example Code Snippet
python
Copy code
import pandas as pd

# Load weather data
df = pd.read_csv('weather_forecast_data.csv')

# Display summary statistics
print(df.describe())

# Example: Plot a histogram of temperatures
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
df['Temperature'].hist(bins=20)
plt.title('Temperature Distribution')
plt.xlabel('Temperature')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.show()
Data Description
The weather_forecast_data.csv file contains the following columns (you can modify this part based on your actual dataset):

Date: Date of the weather forecast.
Location: The location where the forecast is made.
Temperature: Forecasted temperature in degrees Celsius or Fahrenheit.
Humidity: Humidity percentage.
WindSpeed: Wind speed in km/h or mph.
Precipitation: Precipitation levels in mm or inches.
(Note: Adjust column names and descriptions as per the actual dataset structure.)
